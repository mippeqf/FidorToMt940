# FidorToMt940

Python script to convert payment records from Fidor bank accounts in CSV format to the SWIFT format MT940, used in several accounting softwares.

Running the script opens a file input prompt and outputs a ".sta" file in the same directory.

Initial development was part of an import automation framework for the accounting software Collmex at [collmex.de](collmex.de).
